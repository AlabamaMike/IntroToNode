After NPM is installed, run 'npm install' in this directory to install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.\r\n[See here](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) for an introduction to NPM.\r\nAfter dependencies are installed with NPM, you can run the webserver with 'sudo node app.js', or 'node app.js' if you specify an unrestricted port (port 3000 is usually safe).\r\n\r\nThis git repository is ready to be pushed to a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) dyno for free hosting! [Set one up now](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs).\r\n\r\nIf you've found this useful or have any questions, lemme know at [@le\\_isms](http://twitter.com/le_isms).\r\n\r\nYou're free to use any part of this project for anything.\r\n"}
